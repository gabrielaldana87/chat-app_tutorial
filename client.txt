We will be writing a client file using js to be able to communicate with the server.

In order to communicate with the server, we will need a few basic functonalities.

Opening connection
Sending messages
Handling when messages come in

We will have to reference websockets within our client file, which we do so by introducing the following two lines.

As will be discussed in the server.js file; our client JavaScript file (which we will reference as client.js)
needs to first connect to the server.

First our client.js file needs to handle the event of opening a connection with the server.

 ws.on("open",function()
{
  console.log("Connected to server.");
});

As our connection is realized, we console.log a message indicating this connection.

We can likewise broadcast to our server that we have established a connection.

We do so by using the ws.send method.

var ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000");

ws.on("open",function()
{
  console.log("Connected to server.");
  ws.send("client connected!");
});

Our last event-handler will listen for messages being emitted from the server.

We do so by introducing ws.on("message")

This eventListener should console.log data emitted from the server.

ws.on("message", function(data)
{
  console.log(data);
})

Our completed client.js should look as follows:

var ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000");

ws.on("open",function()
{
  console.log("Connected to server.");
  ws.send("client connected!");
});

ws.on("message", function(data)
{
  console.log(data);
})
